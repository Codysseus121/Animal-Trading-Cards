			<p>The Panther is an incredibly intelligent and agile animal that is very seldom
				seen by people in the wild as they are generally very quiet and cautious animals.
				It is a solitary animal that leads a nocturnal lifestyle, spending much of the daylight
				hours resting safely high in the trees.</p>
